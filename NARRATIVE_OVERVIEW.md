📘 Narrative Overview (High‑Level Story)
Your ecosystem is built around a simple but powerful idea:

Modern systems should be modular, explicit, and generative — each component a primitive that can stand alone or combine into larger architectures.

Here’s how the pieces fit:

# Finovia Protocol Notes
This is the conceptual foundation — the economic logic, value flows, and settlement mechanics that define how money, incentives, and state transitions should behave in a modern financial system.

# Modular API Router Tree
This is the service boundary layer — a clean, explicit routing structure that ensures every subsystem communicates through well‑defined contracts.

# SQLite Pipeline Template
This is the state engine — a lightweight, deterministic pipeline for internal tools, automation flows, and operator workflows.

# Celery Automation Boilerplate
This is the execution engine — distributed task orchestration, scheduling, and background processing.

# POSOVIA UI Mock
This is the operator interface — the dashboard where humans interact with the system, monitor flows, and take action.

# Selenium Anti‑Detection Starter
This is the automation edge — the browser‑level automation layer for tasks that require UI interaction.

Together, these repos form a cohesive architectural universe — a portfolio that demonstrates your ability to design systems from protocol to UI, from economic logic to automation pipelines.
