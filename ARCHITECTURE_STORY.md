# 🏗 Architecture Story  
### The conceptual backbone of the ecosystem

This ecosystem didn’t appear all at once. It evolved from solving real problems in finance, commerce, automation, and operator workflows. Each repository represents a moment where a clean, modular primitive was needed — and built.

---

## 🔷 The Origin

It began with **[economic primitives](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20economic%20primitives)** — understanding how value should move through a system.  
From there, the architecture expanded outward:

- incentives →  
- flows →  
- settlement →  
- state transitions →  
- automation →  
- operator interfaces →  
- browser‑level execution  

Each layer demanded its own subsystem.

## 🔷 How Each Repo Emerged

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Finovia Protocol Notes** | **[Economic logic](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Economic%20logic)** — minting, incentives, flows, settlement |
| **Modular API Router Tree** | **[Service boundaries](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Service%20boundaries)** — explicit routing, DTO contracts |
| **SQLite Pipeline Template** | **[State engine](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20State%20engine)** — deterministic pipelines & transitions |
| **Celery Automation Boilerplate** | **[Execution engine](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Execution%20engine)** — workers, schedulers, distributed tasks |
| **POSOVIA UI Mock** | **[Operator interface](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Operator%20interface)** — dashboards, workflows, clarity |
| **Selenium Anti‑Detection Starter** | **[Automation edge](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Automation%20edge)** — browser‑level flows |

## 🔷 Architectural Flow

Finovia → Router Tree → Pipeline Engine → Automation Engine → UI Layer → Browser Automation


Each component is a primitive. Together, they form a cohesive architecture.
